## About Color Switch
"Color Switch is a tap-based obstacle game that adds an additional level of difficulty because you are constantly changing colors. The game offers eight modes, including the recent release of gravity and split. And if you are feeling like you want to mix it up, you also have the option to play challenges in reverse."
